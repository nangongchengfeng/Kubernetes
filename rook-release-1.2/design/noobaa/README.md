# â™œ Rook NooBaa Design

NooBaa is an object data service for hybrid and multi cloud environments. NooBaa runs on kubernetes, provides an S3 object store service (and Lambda with bucket triggers) to clients both inside and outside the cluster, and uses storage resources from within or outside the cluster, with flexible placement policies to automate data use cases.
